# The Genetic Algorithm Phrase Finder

The Genetic Algorithm Phrase Finder is a program I devloped to demonstrate how genetic algorithms work, by you giving the program a target phrase and the program initially guessing what the phrase is and gradually honing in on your correct phrase through generations of crossover and mutation. 

This project was mainly developed as a test of P5js and the concept of genetic algorithms in general.
