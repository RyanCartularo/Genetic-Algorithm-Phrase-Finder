# The Genetic Algorithm Phrase Finder

The Genetic Algorithm Phrase Finder is a program I devloped to demonstrate how genetic algorithms work, by you giving the program a target phrase and the program initially guessing what the phrase is and gradually honing in on your correct phrase through generations of crossover and mutation. 

Here is a link to the website hosting this program if you would like to give it a try: [link](https://ryancartularo.github.io/Genetic-Algorithm-Phrase-Finder/)
